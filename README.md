# IITD Student Assistant Bot

https://flows.mira.network/flows?author=virat&flow=iitd-info-bot

This chatbot is designed to assist IIT Delhi students by providing quick and accurate information on a wide range of topics, from academic queries to general campus information. It leverages Mira Flows with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to ensure responses are both informative and contextually relevant. The chatbot extracts information from official "Course of Study" documents and the BSW (Board for Student Welfare) website, covering course structures, registration processes, academic policies, student welfare initiatives, campus facilities, and more.

## Features

- **Academic Information:** Get detailed information about course structures, credit systems, and grading policies.
- **Registration Guidance:** Assistance with course registration, including add/drop procedures and important deadlines.
- **Academic Policies:** Understand the rules and regulations governing academic performance, probation, and termination.
- **Student Welfare:** Learn about mentorship programs, counseling services, and other support initiatives offered by IIT Delhi.
- **Campus Facilities:** Access information on campus maps, hostel amenities, dining options, and other services available on campus.

## Example Input-Output

### Example Input 1: How does the credit system work at IIT Delhi?
### Output:
The credit system at IIT Delhi operates on a structure where courses are assigned a specific number of credits based on their contact hours and workload. Typically, credits are assigned as follows:

- 1 credit for each hour of lecture (L) per week throughout the semester.
- 1 credit for each hour of tutorial (T) per week throughout the semester.
- 0.5 credits for each hour of laboratory or practical (P) work per week throughout the semester.

For example, a course titled "Introduction to Programming" with a structure of 3-1-2 means:

- 3 hours of lectures per week, earning 3 credits.
- 1 hour of tutorial per week, earning 1 credit.
- 2 hours of laboratory work per week, earning 1 credit (since lab hours are typically credited at half the rate).

Thus, the total credits for this course would be 3 (lectures) + 1 (tutorial) + 1 (lab) = 5 credits.

### Example Input 2: What are the free software licenses I get as an IIT Delhi student?
### Output:
As an IIT Delhi student, you typically have access to a range of free software licenses for academic and research purposes. While specific agreements can change, here are some commonly available software licenses for students:

1. **Microsoft Office 365**: Students can access Microsoft Office applications through the institute’s subscription to Office 365.
2. **MATLAB**: IIT Delhi provides a campus-wide MATLAB license, granting access to MATLAB and various toolboxes.
3. **Autodesk Software**: Access to Autodesk products like AutoCAD, Revit, etc., is often available to students.
4. **Ansys**: Software for engineering simulation is usually available.
5. **IBM SPSS**: Statistical software for data management and analytics may be obtainable through institutional licenses.
6. **SolidWorks**: Mechanical CAD software might be accessible for design and engineering purposes.

For the most current list of available software and access details, students should regularly check with the institute’s computer services or their specific department. Additionally, updates can often be found on the IIT Delhi Computer Services Centre (CSC) webpage or by contacting them directly.
